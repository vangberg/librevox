  * Removed fs_socket requirement from commands, refactored Cmd::Originate

     * FSR::Cmd::Command classes should not require the first argument
       (fs_socket).  Allowing it to be nil enables testing without a fs
       server

       a typecheck determines whether endpoint is an App and runs #raw, or
       a string and just sends the string
