- inbound listener: only subscribe to events w/ hooks, unless `events :all`
  specified

- map more commands/applications.

- check command/application input and raise ArgumentError, possibly.

- filter events

- move test suite from bacon -> test/unit.

- test how this works in async mode - I imagine that it might mess with
  @command_queue

- how can applications be used w/ command socket? would be nice if you could
  do e.g.  originate("user/coltrane", :endpoint => bridge("user/davis"))  and
  it would translate to  "originate user/coltrane &bridge(user/davis)"

- maybe let commands handle the response, so something useful could be returned?

- extension sugar (0.5)
