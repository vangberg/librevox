# Librevox

> An EventMachine-based Ruby library for interacting with the open source 
> telephony platform [FreeSWITCH](http://www.freeswitch.org).

Librevox eventually came to life during a major rewrite of
[Freeswitcher](http://code.rubyists.com/projects/fs/). Not everything would
fit into the existing architecture, and I felt that a blank slate was needed.
Librevox and Freeswitcher looks much alike on the outside, but Librevox tries
to take a simpler approach on the inside.

## Prerequisites

Librevox lets you interact with FreeSWITCH through mod_event_socket. You
should know how the event socket works, and the differences between inbound and
outbound event sockets before proceeding. The
[wiki page on mod_event_socket](http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Event_Socket) is
a good place to start.

Librevox is Ruby 1.9-only.

## Inbound listener

To create an inbound listener, you should subclass `Librevox::Listener::Inbound`
and add custom behaviour to it. An inbound listener subscribes to all events
from FreeSWITCH, and lets you react on events in two different ways:

1.      By overiding `on_event` which gets called every time an event arrives.

2.      By adding an event hook with `event`, which will get called every time
        an event with the specified name arrives.

The header and content of the event is accessible through `event`.

Below is an example of an inbound listener utilising all the aforementioned
techniques:

    require 'librevox'

    class MyInbound < Librevox::Listener::Inbound
      def on_event e
        puts "Got event: #{e.content[:event_name]}"
      end
     
      # You can add a hook for a certain event:
      event :channel_hangup do
        # It is instance_eval'ed, so you can use your instance methods etc:
        do_something
      end

      # If your hook block takes an argument, a Librevox::Response object for
      # the given event is passed on:
      event :channel_bridge do |e|
        ...
      end
     
      def do_something
        ...
      end
    end

## Outbound listener

You create an outbound listener by subclassing `Librevox::Listener::Outbound`. 

### Events

An outbound listener has the same event functionality as the inbound listener,
but it only receives events related to that given session.

### Dialplan

When a call is made and Freeswitch connects to the outbound event listener,
`session_initiated` is called. This is where you set up your dialplan:

    def session_initiated
      answer do
        set "some_var", "some value" do
          playback "path/to/file" do
            hangup
          end
        end
      end
    end

All channel variables are available as a hash named `session`.

When using applications that expect a reply, such as `play_and_get_digits`,
you have to use callbacks to read the value, as the function itself returns
immediately due to the async nature of EventMachine:

    def session_initiated
      answer do
        play_and_get_digits "enter-number.wav", "error.wav" do |digit|
          puts "User pressed #{digit}"
          playback "thanks-for-the-input.wav" do
            hangup
          end
        end
      end
    end

You can also use the commands defined in `Librevox::Command`, which, to avoid
namespace clashes, are accessed through the `api` object:
    
    def session_initiated
      answer do
        api.status
      end
    end

They can be used in conjunction with applications, and do also take a block,
passing the response to an eventual block argument.

## Starting listeners

To start a single listener, connection/listening on localhost on the default
port is quite simple:

    Librevox.start SomeListener

it takes an optional hash with arguments:

    Librevox.start SomeListener, :host => "1.2.3.4", :port => "8087", :auth => "pwd"
    
filters can be applied to a listerner with the filters argument
  
    Librevox.start SomeListener, :filters = ["Event-Name CHANNEL_EXECUTE", "Event-NAME HEARTBEAT"]

Multiple listeners can be started at once by passing a block to `Librevox.start`:

    Librevox.start do
      run SomeListener
      run OtherListener, :port => "8080"
    end
    

## Closing connection

After a session has finished, e.g. because the calling part hangs up, an
outbound socket still has its connection to FreeSWITCH open, so we can get post-
session events. Therefore it is important that you close the connection manually
when you are done. Otherwise you will have 'hanging' sessions, cloggering up
your system. This can safely be done with `close_connection_after_writing`,
which will wait for all outgoing data to be send before closing the connection.
It is aliased as `done` for convenience.

Unless you are doing something specific, closing the connection on CHANNEL_HANGUP
is most likely sufficient:
    
    class MyListener < Librevox::Listener::Outbound
      event :channel_hangup do
        done
      end
    end

## Using `Librevox::CommandSocket`

Librevox also ships with a CommandSocket class, which allows you to connect
to the FreeSWITCH management console, from which you can originate calls,
restart FreeSWITCH etc.

    >> require `librevox/command_socket`
    => true
    
    >> socket = Librevox::CommandSocket.new
    => #<Librevox::CommandSocket:0xb7a89104 @server=“127.0.0.1”,
        @socket=#<TCPSocket:0xb7a8908c>, @port=“8021”, @auth=“ClueCon”>

    >> socket.originate('sofia/user/coltrane', :extension => "1234")
    >> #<Librevox::Response:0x10179d388 @content="+OK de0ecbbe-e847...">
    
    >> socket.status
    >> > #<Librevox::Response:0x1016acac8 ...>

## Further documentation

All applications and commands are documented in the code. You can run
`yardoc` from the root of the source tree to generate YARD docs. Look under
the `Librevox::Commands` and `Librevox::Applications` modules.
